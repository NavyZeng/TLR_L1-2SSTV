# TLR_L1-2SSTV
Matlab demo code for TLR_L1-2SSTV;
# Requirements 
Matlab R2019b
# Data
Demo.m is the main function of our denoising algorithm.
Since the size of Washington DC dataset exceeds the Github file size limit, we did not upload it.
The Washington DC dataset we use in the Demo.m can be downloaded on the following public website:
https://engineering.purdue.edu/~biehl/MultiSpec/hyperspectral.html

Let "WDC"represents the original Washington DC dataset, then, the
subimage "WDC(1025:1280,1:256,1:191)" is used in the Demo.m.

# Note
We promiose that our code will all be updated as .m format as soon as the publication of our paper.
